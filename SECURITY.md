## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Nucleus Ops, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue.** Security vulnerabilities should be handled discreetly to protect users.
2.  Send an email to **security@nucleus-ops.com**.
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any potential impact.
4.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
5.  Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will publish a security advisory and credit you for the discovery (if desired).

Thank you for helping keep Nucleus Ops secure!
