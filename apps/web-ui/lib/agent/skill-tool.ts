 * the agent calls load_skill(skill_id) at the moment a task phase needs those
 * instructions. Multiple skills can be loaded across one run, each on demand,
 * with no upfront token cost for unused skills.
 *
 * Tenant-scoped and enabled-only: getSkillContent() returns null for disabled
 * or unknown slugs, so a disabled skill (veto) can never be loaded mid-run.
