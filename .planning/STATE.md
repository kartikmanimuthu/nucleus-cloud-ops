## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key decisions affecting Phase 1:

- ORM: Prisma (not Drizzle) — user prefers Prisma DX; accepted Lambda bundle size trade-off (~2-4MB)
- Repository pattern with feature flags — zero-downtime, instant rollback per entity
- Docker Compose for local dev — cloud DB (RDS/Aurora) deferred until migration validated

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Lambda bundle size: Prisma engine is ~2-4MB. Monitor cold start impact once Lambda phases begin (Phase 3+).
- AgentConversationsTable: Usage unverified — must confirm dead code or live usage before Phase 5.
